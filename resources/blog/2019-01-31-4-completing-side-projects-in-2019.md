# 2018 in Review

Since getting into [bullet](https://www.pinterest.com/bulletjournal/) [journaling](http://bulletjournal.com/) I enjoy reflecting on how I spent my time at the end of the year. In 2018 I've been sleeping more, working closer to 40 hours a week, and I've more consistent with my schedule. There is however one major problem: I did not complete a single major side project!

## How did I not complete a single major side project in 2018?

It comes down to my work habits. Looking at my how I spent my time I have two modes: Sprinting towards a finish line at a ridiculous pace or sloth mode criminally chilling between projects. I did finish some smaller side projects, ones that could be sprinted through in a few late nights and a weekend. However, the larger problem appears to be a cycle I've created: Sprint through a small project, sloth it up until I recover and move on to the next project to start the cycle again. Now I know what the problem is, how do I improve?

## How do you manage your time for side projects?

In researching a few articles, books, and a bit of discussion I've found several practices I have incorporated to help make 2019 the year of side projects:

1. Break down your projects into the tiniest goals. If you know a project is going to take months: compose it down into 20min tasks. Working on a month long project is terrifying; working on a 20min task sounds like a good way to start or end the day.
2. Be consistent when you work on side projects. It's much easier to plan your day when you know 10:30 to 11 am is your side project time.
3. Try to work a little bit on a side project many days in a row. Once the habit forms, it feels weird not to spend mornings on a side project. Once you stop it feels weird to resume working on a side project.
4. Don't sprint and exhaust yourself. Instead try working on side projects a little bit at a time from 20 minutes to an hour and half. That way you can keep the pace up for longer stretches of time without burning out or loosing interest.
5. Try incorporating a no electronics or work\\projects day into your schedule so you at least get one day to focus on enjoying or taking care of yourself. Sometimes you may find getting an extra day to think helps solve difficult problems you were stuck on the day before.

## Does this advice actually work?

This blog is the proof that applying those practices did help me complete at least one project this year. Other project ideas came up while working on this blog but I did my best to write them down so I can return to them later. I imagine with more practice using the above ideas I may improve further but how do you stop?

## How do you stop when you are enjoying yourself?

My biggest issue is stopping myself when those 20 minutes are up. There were parts of this blog I really enjoyed working on and felt compelled to see features through. It almost physically hurts to stop working on a task that seems reachable within a few minutes to an hour. I don't have a great solution for this yet but after asking the community in the Clojure slack I got some good advice:

1. Set a physical alarm somewhere you have to get up and stop. This way you can't just over-work  on a side project and turn it into a sprint.
2. Reward yourself for being disciplined. Go ahead, put in your 20 min then get a fancy hipster coffee. You deserve it.
3. Switch gears to a more enjoyable activity. If your problem is that you enjoy something and have a hard time stopping, watch a movie, play a game, go on a date, eat, it just has to be motivating enough for the mind to want to switch.
4. When the timer is up, make sure you take a break or switch tasks. Treat it as an equally important part of the process as the task itself.

Of course I accidentally thought up of another side project in the form of a CLI tool that closes a TMUX environment or other shell command after a time limit (likely killing any running development REPLs and servers). It still needs fleshing out but I did manage to create some wireframes:

## What’s next?

I think the key to stopping is that I simply need to practice being disciplined. After more than a decade of working like this I need to really put some time and effort into breaking those habits. There are three ways I'm going to approach this:

1. Read books on building habits and discipline. Learning how to influence the brain’s decision making and reactions to stimuli will be very valuable in figuring out a more actionable plan.
2. Practice using the advice above to develop discipline
3. Track side project time in my bullet journal so I can observe improvements or patterns
